attribute:

- defer:
	waits for HTML To be parsed before loading the javascript file
- module:
	unlocks import/export capability


package.json:

"react-scripts" import in package.json transforms your files behind the scenes and adjust + loads the transformed source code


Tree of components rendered inside the #root by react. React combines everything to generate a DOM

---------------
React HOOKS:
---------------

useState Hook:
-------------------
useState referesh the whole component in which it is called

const [val, set] = useState("val") 

We can use "const" because behind the scenes react will tell the component to be refreshed, and pass the actual new "val" from behind the scenes. 
The updated value is only available once the component has been refreshed

Patterns
*******************
------------------------------
Forwarded Props or Proxy props:
-------------------------------
by default React does not forward props like id, className and other HTML attributes, we must therefore structure them as a props (...props)
and then destructure them on the parent tag {...props}

export default function Section({ title, children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <section {...props}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}

---------------------------
multiple JSX Slots (passing jsx without being children)
---------------------------

To do so we can pass a prop, to the target component and send the element of interest. 
Example: You want to build a menu by attaching the tabButtons to the <menu> element, but maybe there are other parts of the application were you don't wish to do so 
maybe you want to attach to the <li> to the <ul> 

* for example if i want to attach it to a custom component I could do the following.
buttonsContainer={Section}

* or if I want to attach it to a native element I could do the following:
buttonsContainer="menu"


example:

export default function Tabs({
  children,
  buttons,
  buttonsContainer, //custom container maybe for different parts of the application
  ...props
}) {
  const ButtonsContainer = buttonsContainer; //react will look for value in buttonsContainer and either look for built in or custom component
  return (
    <>
      <ButtonsContainer {...props}>{buttons}</ButtonsContainer>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}


The prop can also start with an upper case character liek ButtonsContainer to avoid setting up a const ButtonsContainer = buttonsContainer


-------------------
image accessibility
-------------------

images inside the /public directory will not be handle by the underlying build process.
images inside src/assets/ will be handled by the build process and are generally images made available through code

********************
STATE MANAGEMENT
********************

-------------------
Updating State
-------------------

If updating state depends on previous state, you must past a function to update the state (guarantees the latest state value):

setIsEditing((isEditing) => !isEditing); instead of setIsEditing(!isEditing)

this setIsEditing(!isEditing) is a scheduled state update but not immediately changed

---------------------------------------
mutating state (for arrays and objects)
----------------------------------------

You must NOT mutate the state of a state value! This is because items in javascript are just references to the objects.
so if you mutate the state, javascript will immediatelly change the value in memory leading to unintended consequences.

So instead of this:
-------------------

const handleSelectSquare = (rowIdx, colIdx) =>  {
        setGameBoard((prevGameBoard) => {
            prevGameBoard[rowIdx][colIdx] = "X";
            return prevGameBoard;;
        })
    }

Do this:
----------

const handleSelectSquare = (rowIdx, colIdx) =>  {
        setGameBoard((prevGameBoard) => {
            const updatedBoard = [...prevGameBoard].map(innerArray => [...innerArray]);
            updatedBoard[rowIdx][colIdx] = "X";
            return updatedBoard;
        })
    }


-----------------------------
Lifting the state up (Kind of like Angular Emit)
-----------------------------

Lift the state to the closest Ancestor component that has access to both components that needs communication.

              Ancestor component (has state and manages it for both children)
                      |
		      |
   _______________________________________	
  |                                       |
  |				          |
Child 1             			Child 2




--------------------------
Avoid Merging States
--------------------------

Don't merge state directly when:

You want to avoid stale values due to async rendering/batching.


------------------------
Objects & Array immutability
------------------------

You should always replace objects or array when using state objects




*********************
Styling
*********************

Vanilla Css
----------
Styling is not scopped to components because react will inject all the style in the <head> element of the app (global css)

- For valina CSS you can just pass the css inside the style prop as style={{color: 'red'}}, this is inline style.

Css Modules:
-------
- To scope valina css to component use [CSS Modules]:
	- css file must be named with name.module.css => Header.module.css
	- then imported into component as  import classes from "./Header.module.css"
	- and used inline <p className={classes.myclass}

Styled-components:
------

npm package used for styling elements as components

import {styled} from "styled-components"

(the backticks are at the end of div, and this is called Tagged Templates)

const ControlContainer = styled.div`
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 1.5rem;
`

- The above returns a normal react component with the all the props including the children prop.
- Means that the styled Component can receive props like any react component:
	* 
	const Label = styled.label`
  	display: block;
  	margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
  	font-size: 0.75rem;
  	font-weight: 700;
  	letter-spacing: 0.1em;
  	text-transform: uppercase;
  	color: ${({invalid}) => invalid ? '#f87171' : '#6b7280'};
	`;
In the above the 'invalid' prop was passed to the component inside the JSX


Working around built-in props:
----

If the prop name we are passing down to the component is conflicts with an existing one just add a $ before it. 
This is for props that will ONLY BE USED in STYLING code.

EX:
	instead of =>: <Input invalid={isValid}/> use: <Input $invalid={isValid}/> 



Conditional tailwindcss classes:
----

this tool might be useful for that:

	import clsx from 'clsx';

	const labelClasses = clsx(
  	"mb-2 block text-xs font-bold uppercase tracking-wide",
  	invalid ? "text-red-400" : "text-stone-300"
	);
